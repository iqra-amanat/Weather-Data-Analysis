## Project Overview:

Add a brief description of what your project is about and its goal (e.g., "This project analyzes weather data to identify trends in temperature, humidity, and other factors").


## Dataset Details:

Mention the source of the dataset and describe the columns it contains (e.g., "The dataset contains columns like Temperature, Dew Point, and Wind Speed").



## key Findings:

Highlight some significant insights or patterns found in the data (e.g., "Temperature tends to rise during certain months").


## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

Date/Time: Timestamps for weather observations.

Temperature (°C): The recorded temperature in Celsius.

Dew Point Temperature (°C): The temperature below which dew forms.

Rel Hum_%: Relative Humidity (in percentage).

Wind Speed_km/h: Wind speed in kilometers per hour.

Visibility_km: Visibility in kilometers.

Press_kPa: Atmospheric pressure in kilopascals.

## Project Workflow

### 1.  Data Cleaning

Handled missing values by imputing the mean for numerical columns.

Converted the Date/Time column to a datetime format for better time-series analysis.


### 2.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Calculated summary statistics to understand the data distribution.

Visualized temperature distribution, time-series trends, and correlations between variables.

Performed seasonal analysis to identify patterns in temperature over months.


### 3.  Visualizations

Temperature Distribution: Histogram showing the distribution of temperatures.

Temperature Over Time: Line chart depicting temperature changes over time.

Temperature vs Humidity: Scatterplot visualizing the correlation between temperature and relative humidity.

Average Temperature by Month: Bar chart highlighting monthly average temperatures.

Wind Speed vs Pressure: Scatterplot analyzing the relationship between wind speed and atmospheric pressure.

## Key Insights

1. The hottest month(s) observed in the dataset is Month X (replace with your results).


2. The coldest month(s) observed in the dataset is Month X (replace with your results).


3. Relative humidity has a positive/negative/no clear correlation with temperature.


4. Seasonal trends reveal that temperature changes significantly over months, indicating clear seasonal variations.
